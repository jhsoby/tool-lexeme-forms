# Wikidata Lexeme Forms

[This tool](https://lexeme-forms.toolforge.org/) lets users create Wikidata lexemes with pre-populated forms,
such as the declensions of a noun or the conjugations of a verb.

## Toolforge setup

On Wikimedia Toolforge, this tool runs under the `lexeme-forms` tool name.
Source code resides in `~/www/python/src/`,
a virtual environment is set up in `~/www/python/venv/`,
logs end up in `~/uwsgi.log`.
The `uwsgi.ini` configuration file in the source code repository
is symlinked into `~/www/python/uwsgi.ini`.

If the web service is not running for some reason, run the following command:
```
webservice start
```
If it’s acting up, try the same command with `restart` instead of `start`.
Both should pull their config from the `service.template` file,
which is symlinked from the source code directory into the tool home directory.

To update the service, run the following commands after becoming the tool account:
```
webservice shell
source ~/www/python/venv/bin/activate
cd ~/www/python/src
git fetch
git diff @ @{u} # inspect changes
git merge --ff-only @{u}
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
webservice restart
```
However, the `venv` and `pip3` parts are only necessary when new packages are required –
if only `templates.py` and/or `translations.py` were updated, you can skip those.

## Local development setup

You can also run the tool locally, which is much more convenient for development
(for example, Flask will automatically reload the application any time you save a file).
Note that a local setup will not actually perform edits unless you create a `config.yaml` file.

```
git clone https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/source/tool-lexeme-forms.git
cd tool-lexeme-forms
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run --extra-files i18n/
```

If you want, you can do this inside some virtualenv too.
